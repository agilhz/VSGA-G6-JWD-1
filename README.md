## Installation

### Prebuilt packages and binaries

Prebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.

For Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from
[windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). After extracting the archive the
`*.exe` files are ready to use.

For other systems, see the [installation chapter](https://php.net/install).

### Building PHP source code

*For Windows, see [Build your own PHP on Windows](https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2).*

For a minimal PHP build from Git, you will need autoconf, bison, and re2c. For
a default build, you will additionally need libxml2 and libsqlite3.

On Ubuntu, you can install these using:

    sudo apt install -y pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c \
                        libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev

On Fedora, you can install these using:

    sudo dnf install re2c bison autoconf make libtool ccache libxml2-devel sqlite-devel

Generate configure:

    ./buildconf

Configure your build. `--enable-debug` is recommended for development, see
`./configure --help` for a full list of options.

    # For development
    ./configure --enable-debug
    # For production
    ./configure

Build PHP. To speed up the build, specify the maximum number of jobs using `-j`:

    make -j4

The number of jobs should usually match the number of available cores, which
can be determined using `nproc`.

## Testing PHP source code

PHP ships with an extensive test suite, the command `make test` is used after
successful compilation of the sources to run this test suite.

It is possible to run tests using multiple cores by setting `-jN` in
`TEST_PHP_ARGS`:

    make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j4 test

Shall run `make test` with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs: Generally the maximum
number of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.

The [qa.php.net](https://qa.php.net) site provides more detailed info about
testing and quality assurance.

## Installing PHP built from source

After a successful build (and test), PHP may be installed with:

    make install

Depending on your permissions and prefix, `make install` may need super user
permissions.

## PHP extensions

Extensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many
essential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP
Extension Community Library - [PECL](https://pecl.php.net).

## Contributing

The PHP source code is located in the Git repository at
[github.com/php/php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src). Contributions are most
welcome by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Discussions are done on GitHub, but depending on the topic can also be relayed
to the official PHP developer mailing list internals@lists.php.net.

New features require an RFC and must be accepted by the developers. See
[Request for comments - RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc) and
[Voting on PHP features](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting) for more information
on the process.

Bug fixes don't require an RFC. If the bug has a GitHub issue, reference it in
the commit message using `GH-NNNNNN`. Use `#NNNNNN` for tickets in the old
[bugs.php.net](https://bugs.php.net) bug tracker.

    Fix GH-7815: php_uname doesn't recognise latest Windows versions
    Fix #55371: get_magic_quotes_gpc() throws deprecation warning

See [Git workflow](https://wiki.php.net/vcs/gitworkflow) for details on how pull
requests are merged.
